# Autodifferentiation and Minimization Module

Autodifferentiation module (Functions)

1) Get the analytical gradient of any function defined by the User
by using objects and operator overloading (Lip).

2) Get any derivative from any mathematical expression.

Minimization module

1) Unconstrained minimization of any function defined with the Autodifferentiation package

2) Lagragian minimization with linear constraints (Being Implemented)

3) Gradient Descent, Nesterov Momentum, Adagrad, Adadelta and Adam algorithms implemented

4) Second order minimization algorithms (Being Implemented)
